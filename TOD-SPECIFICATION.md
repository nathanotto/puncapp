# PUNC Chapter Management App
## Task-Oriented Design Specification

**Version:** 2.0 (TOD Rewrite)  
**Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Design Philosophy:** Task-Oriented Design  
**Tech Stack:** Next.js, Supabase, Vercel

---

## Part I: Design Philosophy

### What is Task-Oriented Design?

Task-Oriented Design (TOD) is a methodology for building business applications where the **task** is the primary unit of design. Unlike data-model-first approaches that produce CRUD interfaces, or feature-first approaches that produce capability menus, TOD produces applications that mirror how humans actually work: doing one thing at a time, needing the right context to decide, acting, and knowing it mattered.

**Core principles:**

1. **Task primacy**: Users come to accomplish specific tasks, not to interact with data models
2. **Context sufficiency**: Present exactly the information needed to decide/act—no more, no less
3. **Action clarity**: Make the primary action obvious; secondary actions discoverable
4. **Confirmation completeness**: Users must know: it worked, what it means, what happens next
5. **Flow continuity**: Tasks trigger other tasks; completion begets continuation
6. **Exception visibility**: Handle the unhappy path as explicitly as the happy path

### The Emotional Architecture

TOD recognizes that users need to feel effective. Every task screen should produce:

- **Clarity**: "I know exactly what I'm being asked to do, and why I want to do it"
- **Efficacy**: "I have what I need to do it"
- **Completion**: "I did it, and I know it took"
- **Consequence**: "My action mattered—something happened because of it"

### How This Spec Is Organized

1. **Task Flows**: The primary design artifacts. Each flow maps trigger → context → action → confirmation → downstream effects
2. **Task Screens**: Derived from flows. Each screen serves one task.
3. **State Machines**: For entities that move through processes
4. **Data Model**: Derived from what flows need to function
5. **Implementation Patterns**: Reusable components and architectural guidance

**When building features, always start with the Task Flow.** The flow is the source of truth. Screens, APIs, and data structures serve the flow, not the other way around.

## Part II: Task Flows

Each task flow follows this structure:

```
FLOW: [Name]
Actors: [Who can trigger/perform this task]
Trigger: [What initiates this task]

[TASK: Task Name]
├─ Context Needed: [What information the actor needs to decide/act]
├─ Actor Sees: [The task prompt—what are they being asked?]
├─ Actor Does: [The available actions]
├─ System Response: [What happens immediately]
├─ Confirmation: [What the actor sees/knows after acting]
└─ Downstream: [What tasks this triggers, for whom]

[Exception handling as explicit branches]
```

│
├─ Confirmation:
│   If accepted: "Welcome to [Chapter Name]. Your first meeting is [Date]."
│   If declined: "Got it. We'll keep you on the waitlist for other opportunities."

```

---

### Flow 7: Chapter Split

When a chapter grows to its maximum size (12), it can choose to split into two chapters. The split requires a Special Consideration Meeting to discuss and decide, then the Leader executes the split.

```
FLOW: Chapter Split
Actors: Chapter Leader, Members
Trigger: Special Consideration Meeting decides to split

Prerequisites:
- Chapter member count >= 9 (ideal size is 5-8)
- Special Consideration Meeting held with "Chapter Split" topic
- Members have discussed and agreed to split

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TASK: Initiate Chapter Split]
Actor: Chapter Leader
Trigger: Special Consideration Meeting approved split

├─ Context Needed:
│   • Current chapter details
│   • Member list (all members)
│   • Special Consideration outcome confirming split decision
│   • Constraint: member_count >= 9
│
├─ Actor Sees:
│   "Split [Chapter Name]"
│   "Current members: [count]"
│   "After split, each chapter should have 5-8 members."
│   [Member list with assignment toggles: Original Chapter / New Chapter]
│   [New chapter name field]
│
├─ Actor Does:
│   • Assign each member to Original or New chapter
│   • Ensure each chapter has at least 5 members
│   • Name the new chapter
│   • Confirm: "I will temporarily lead both chapters until a new Leader is chosen"
│   → [Split Chapter]
│
├─ System Response:
│   Chapter status → "splitting"
│   Creates new Chapter (status: open)
│   Assigns Leader to both chapters (temporary)
│   Moves designated members to new chapter
│   Original chapter status → "open" (split complete)
│
├─ Confirmation:
│   "[Original Chapter] and [New Chapter] are now separate chapters."
│   "You are temporarily leading both chapters."
│   "Each chapter should choose permanent leadership at their next meeting."
│
└─ Downstream:
    → All members notified of their chapter assignment
    → Members in new chapter receive welcome to new chapter
    → Both chapters prompted to schedule next meeting
    → Reminder created: "Choose new Leader for [New Chapter]"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EXCEPTION: Member Wants Both Chapters
├─ Context: Some members may want to remain in both chapters
├─ This requires Special Consideration by the chapter(s)
├─ If approved:
│   • Member maintains membership in both chapters
│   • Counts toward member limit in both
│   • Receives notifications from both
│   • Constraint: max 2 chapter memberships still applies
└─ Tracked as: dual membership approved via Special Consideration

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TASK: Choose New Chapter Leader]
Actor: Chapter Members (new chapter)
Trigger: Split complete, leadership transition needed

├─ Context Needed:
│   • Current temporary Leader
│   • Certified Leaders in the chapter (if any)
│   • Members willing to become certified
│
├─ Actor Sees:
│   "[New Chapter] needs a permanent Leader"
│   "Current temporary Leader: [Name]"

│   [Option: Volunteer to become Leader (requires certification)]
│
├─ Actor Does:
│   • Nominate self or another certified member
│   • Or: request Leader certification process
│
├─ System Response:
│   If certified member accepts: assigns as Leader
│   Removes temporary Leader role (if they were only temporary)
│
├─ Confirmation:
│   "[Name] is now the Leader of [New Chapter]."
│   "The chapter is ready to continue independently."
│
└─ Downstream:
    → Former temporary Leader notified
    → New Leader receives Leader onboarding (if first time)
```

## Part III: State Machines

For entities that move through processes, define their states explicitly.

### Meeting State Machine

```
States: scheduled → in_progress → completed → validated
                 ↘ cancelled

Meeting Types:
- standard: Regular chapter meeting with Lightning Round, Long Check-ins, Curriculum
- special_consideration: Open discussion meeting to address chapter issues

Transitions:
- scheduled → in_progress: Leader clicks "Start Meeting"
- scheduled → cancelled: Leader cancels meeting
- in_progress → completed: Leader clicks "End Meeting"
- completed → validated: Leader validates meeting

Constraints:
- Only Leader or Backup Leader can trigger transitions
- Cannot transition backward
- Validation requires: attendance recorded, duration > 0
- Validation for donor funding additionally requires: audio present
- Special Consideration meetings require: outcome notes recorded
```

### Commitment State Machine

```
States: pending → completed
               → abandoned

Sub-states for "completed":
- self_reported_complete (awaiting recipient confirmation, if applicable)
- confirmed_complete (recipient confirmed OR no recipient)
- disputed (recipient says not complete)

Transitions:
- pending → completed: Maker marks complete
- pending → abandoned: Maker abandons
- completed → disputed: Recipient disputes
- disputed → confirmed_complete: Leader resolves

Constraints:
- Only Maker can mark complete/abandoned
- Only Recipient can dispute
- Only Leader can resolve disputes
```

### User Status State Machine

```
States: unassigned → assigned → inactive

Transitions:
- unassigned → assigned: Approved for chapter membership
- assigned → unassigned: Left all chapters voluntarily
- assigned → inactive: Removed by Leader or Admin
- inactive → unassigned: Reactivated by Admin

Constraints:
- User can be in max 2 chapters simultaneously
- User can be Leader in max 2 chapters
```

### Chapter Status State Machine

```
States: forming → open → closed
                   ↓
               splitting → open (original) + open (new chapter)

Transitions:
- forming → open: 5+ members confirmed AND first meeting held
- open → closed: Leader closes OR Admin closes
- open → splitting: Leader initiates split (requires member_count >= 9)
- splitting → open: Split completes, original chapter continues
- splitting → [new chapter created as open]: New chapter created with subset of members
- closed → open: Admin reopens

Constraints:
- Forming chapters have limited functionality (no funding, no curriculum progression)
- Closed chapters are read-only (history preserved)
- Splitting requires member_count >= 9 (ideal chapter size is 5-8, max is 12)
- During split: Leader temporarily leads both chapters until new Leader chosen for one
- Split creates new chapter directly as "open" (no forming period, since members are experienced)
```

---

## Part IV: Task Screen Patterns

Every task screen follows this structure. Use these patterns in implementation.

### TaskScreen Component Structure

```tsx
interface TaskScreenProps {
  // The prompt: why am I here, what am I being asked?
  prompt: {
    title: string;
    subtitle?: string;
  };
  
  // The context: what do I need to know to decide?
  context: React.ReactNode;
  
  // The action: what can I do?
  actions: {
    primary: ActionButton;
    secondary?: ActionButton[];
  };
  
  // The feedback: what happened?
  feedback?: {
    type: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning';
    message: string;
    nextStep?: string;
    downstream?: string; // what this triggered
  };
}
```

### Information Hierarchy on Task Screens

1. **Prompt** (top): What you're being asked to do. Large, clear, imperative.
2. **Context** (middle): Information needed to decide. Scannable, relevant, no extras.
3. **Action** (bottom): Primary action prominent. Secondary actions available but not competing.
4. **Feedback** (replaces/overlays): Confirmation with consequence and next step.

### Loading States

Every task screen needs:
- **Loading state**: While fetching context
- **Error state**: If context can't be loaded
- **Empty state**: If no data (e.g., no pending tasks)

### Confirmation Patterns

**Inline confirmation** (for quick actions):
```
Action taken. [Consequence]. [Next step or "Nothing more needed."]
```

**Modal confirmation** (for significant actions):
```
[Summary of what happened]
[Consequence: what changed]
[Downstream: what this triggered]
[Dismiss] or [Next Task]
```

**Toast notification** (for background completions):
```
[Brief: Action complete]
```

---

## Part V: Data Model (Derived from Flows)

The data model serves the flows. Here's what's needed:

### Core Entities

```typescript
// User: a man in the system
User {
  id: uuid
  name: string
  email: string
  phone: string
  address: Address
  username: string // display name for privacy
  display_preference: 'real_name' | 'username'
  status: 'unassigned' | 'assigned' | 'inactive'
  leader_certified: boolean
  leader_certification_date: datetime | null
  leader_certification_expiry: datetime | null
}

// Chapter: a group of men meeting regularly
Chapter {
  id: uuid
  name: string
  status: 'forming' | 'open' | 'closed'
  max_members: integer // default 12
  meeting_schedule: RecurringSchedule
  default_location: Address
  monthly_cost: decimal // default $55
  current_balance: decimal
  funding_status: 'fully_funded' | 'partially_funded' | 'deficit' | 'surplus'
}

// ChapterMembership: user's membership in a chapter
ChapterMembership {
  id: uuid
  chapter_id: uuid -> Chapter
  user_id: uuid -> User
  member_type: 'regular' | 'contributing'
  joined_at: datetime
  left_at: datetime | null
  is_active: boolean
}

// Meeting: a chapter gathering
Meeting {
  id: uuid
  chapter_id: uuid -> Chapter
  scheduled_datetime: datetime
  status: 'scheduled' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'validated' | 'cancelled'
  scribe_id: uuid | null -> User
  actual_start: datetime | null
  actual_end: datetime | null
  curriculum_module_id: uuid | null -> CurriculumModule
  audio_recording_url: string | null
  validated_at: datetime | null
  validated_by: uuid | null -> User
}

// Attendance: who was at a meeting
Attendance {
  id: uuid
  meeting_id: uuid -> Meeting
  user_id: uuid -> User
  rsvp_status: 'yes' | 'no' | 'maybe' | 'no_response'
  rsvp_reason: string | null // required if rsvp_status = 'no'
  attendance_type: 'in_person' | 'video' | 'absent' | null
  checked_in_at: datetime | null
  lightning_round_time_used: integer | null // seconds
  priority: 1 | 2 | null // for long check-in ordering
}

// Commitment: something a member commits to
Commitment {
  id: uuid
  chapter_id: uuid -> Chapter
  made_by: uuid -> User
  made_at_meeting: uuid | null -> Meeting
  commitment_type: 'stretch_goal' | 'to_member' | 'volunteer' | 'help_favor'
  description: text
  recipient_id: uuid | null -> User
  deadline: datetime | null
  status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'abandoned' | 'disputed'
  self_reported_status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'abandoned'
  recipient_reported_status: 'pending' | 'completed' | null
  resolved_by: uuid | null -> User
  resolved_at: datetime | null
}
```

### Task Queue (for triggering downstream tasks)

```typescript
// PendingTask: a task waiting to be done
PendingTask {
  id: uuid
  task_type: string // e.g., 'respond_to_rsvp', 'confirm_commitment', etc.
  assigned_to: uuid -> User
  related_entity_type: string // 'meeting', 'commitment', etc.
  related_entity_id: uuid
  created_at: datetime
  due_at: datetime | null
  completed_at: datetime | null
  dismissed_at: datetime | null
}
```

This enables the system to show users "you have tasks waiting" and to trigger notifications.

---

## Part VI: Implementation Guidance for Claude Code

### Starting a New Feature

1. **Find the relevant Task Flow** in this document
2. **Identify the Task Screen(s)** needed
3. **Check the State Machine** for any entity state transitions
4. **Build the screen** following the TaskScreen pattern
5. **Implement the downstream triggers** (create PendingTask records, send notifications)
6. **Test the full flow** end-to-end, including confirmations

### File Organization

```
/app
  /tasks                    # Task screens organized by flow
    /meeting-cycle
      /schedule-meeting
      /respond-to-rsvp
      /start-meeting
      /run-lightning-round
      /close-meeting
      /validate-meeting
    /onboarding
      /sign-up
      /find-chapter
      /apply-to-chapter
    /commitments
      /create-commitment
      /update-commitment
      /confirm-commitment
  /components
    /task                   # Reusable task UI components
      TaskScreen.tsx
      TaskPrompt.tsx
      TaskContext.tsx
      TaskActions.tsx
      TaskConfirmation.tsx
    /meeting-runner         # Meeting-specific components
      LightningRoundTimer.tsx
      AttendanceChecklist.tsx
      CurriculumDisplay.tsx
```

### API Design

APIs should be task-oriented, not CRUD-oriented:

```
// Instead of:
POST /api/meetings/:id/attendance  // generic CRUD

// Use:
POST /api/tasks/check-in-to-meeting  // task-oriented
POST /api/tasks/submit-rsvp
POST /api/tasks/mark-commitment-complete
POST /api/tasks/validate-meeting
```

The API endpoint should:
1. Validate the actor has permission for this task
2. Validate the preconditions (entity is in correct state)
3. Execute the state transition
4. Create downstream PendingTask records
5. Return confirmation with consequence and next step

### Notification Strategy

Notifications are how users know they have tasks. Each PendingTask should trigger:

1. **In-app**: Badge/count on nav, task list in dashboard
2. **Email**: For tasks with deadlines or time sensitivity
3. **Push** (future): Same as email, user preference

Notification content should follow the task prompt pattern:
- What you're being asked to do
- Enough context to act (or link to full context)
- Clear CTA

---

## Part VII: Reference

### Glossary

- **Task**: A discrete unit of work a user performs, with context, action, and confirmation
- **Flow**: A sequence of tasks that accomplish a larger goal
- **Task Screen**: The UI for performing a single task
- **Downstream**: Tasks triggered by completing another task
- **State Machine**: The allowed states and transitions for an entity
- **Confirmation**: Feedback showing action succeeded, consequence, and next step
- **Context**: Information needed to make a decision or take an action

### Design Philosophy Reminders

When in doubt, ask:
- Is the task clear? Does the user know what they're being asked?
- Is the context sufficient? Do they have what they need to decide?
- Is the action obvious? Is there one clear thing to do?
- Is the confirmation complete? Do they know it worked, what it means, and what's next?

### Original Specification Reference

For detailed data model fields, API endpoints, and screen layouts, refer to `SPECIFICATION.md`. This TOD specification takes precedence for design decisions and flow structure; the original spec provides implementation details.
